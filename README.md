# 🧠 AI Content Analyzer

Welcome to my mini project — **AI Content Analyzer**!  
This is a simple backend app built using Flask and Hugging Face Transformers. You can send some text, and it gives you back a smart response like a summary or other AI-generated output (based on what model you use).

Right now it’s a basic working version, but I plan to add more features and even connect a frontend soon!

## 🚀 What it does

- Takes input text from the user
- Passes it to a transformer model (like BART or T5)
- Sends back the generated output (like a summary)
- It's built in Python using Flask for backend, and Hugging Face Transformers for the AI magic
